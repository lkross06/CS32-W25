The stack-based algorithm performs a depth-first search, in which it checks as deep down the path it can until hitting a dead-end, then branching off of any pre-existing paths. The FIFO nature of a stack prioritizes the newest cells found before older cells, so progress through the maze happens in paths and branches of paths.

On the other hand, the queue-based algorithm performs a breadth-first search, in which it searches the vicinity of cells from the starting cell (much like how water might flow through the maze). The LIFO nature of a queue prioritizes the oldest cells found before newer cells, so progress through the maze happens simulatneously in all directions.
