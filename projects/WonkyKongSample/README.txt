To run WonkyKong:

1. Locate the folder WonkyKongSample, which should have in it files named
WonkyKong and Assets.  It's likely that the path to the folder will be
/Users/yourname/WonkyKongSample or /Users/yourname/Downloads/WonkyKongSample.

2. Open a Terminal window and type
        cd whateverThePathIs
where you should replace whateverThePathIs with the path to the
WonkyKongSample folder.

3. Confirm you're in the right folder by typing
        ls
which should show you the Assets folder and the WonkyKong executable.

4. Type
        ./WonkyKong
to play the game.

Alternatively, in the folder WonkyKong, you can move the Assets folder
to your home directory, then double-click on the WonkyKong executable
file.
